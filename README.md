# react-redux-boilerplate
Boilerplate project for a webapp using React/Redux architecture.


## Getting started

1. Clone this repository and delete the .git folder
1. Remove/Adapt all example components if necessary:
   component/button
   modules/counter
   views/home
   routes.js
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run dev`
1. Your application is running on http://localhost:ENV.PORT || 5000


## Roadmap
- Use webpack DLL, split vendor from local code
- Use dummy loaders on webpack.server so it builds faster
- Hashify bundle to invalidate cache, add bundle <script> dynamically
